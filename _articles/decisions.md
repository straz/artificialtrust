Our brains store decisions, like ingredients in a cupboard.  We keep
these decisions around to inform further decisions.  We decide what we
want for lunch, who we'll go out with, or whether the roof needs
fixing. Once we decide what we want for lunch, we then decide how to
go about getting it. Pizza for lunch? The next decision might well be
choosing toppings, or choosing between delivery or pick up.


### Getting more brains

The decisions you keep are not always the decisions you make by
yourself. A friend tells you about a great new pizza place, so you
decide to try it.  That's how we use the brains of others &mdash; we
rely on them to give us decisions that we can keep and use later.

Trusted sources are friends who share their brainwork with us.  We
adopt their decisions, often without deep examination, adding them to
our own.

### Trust is the decision you keep

When you keep a decision around, you trust it. You tell yourself,
"I've made this decision, it can be used now." It's more comfortable
to keep the decisions you've already made than to discard them.

Of course you can go back and look at one again, maybe even reverse
it. It means you don't trust it any more.

But it's expensive to go back and check a decision. It takes time and
effort. While you're doing all that checking, you can't move
forward. You might waste your time, and miss out on something.

Trust is the great time-saver for brains. It's a shortcut. It means
you can just use a ready-made decision you made earlier. You don't
need to go back and revisit it.

### The trust recognizer

How do we choose what to believe in? We have a gatekeeper which
decides what's trustworthy and what isn't.  This is our trust
recognizer. It sets the bar for the decisions we abide by, decisions
we disavow, and decisions we need to re-examine. It is the arbiter of
what "feels right."

When we choose what to have for lunch, we're influenced by a wide
range of inputs: hunches, appetites, experience, reason, evidence, and
the suggestions of complete strangers. Our trust recognizer is no
different. It employs the very same mechanisms and influences as our
other decisions. How rigorously we decide what to believe in is no
more or less disciplined than how we decide what to eat for lunch, and
just as susceptible to manipulation and mistakes.

The trust recognizer is special in just one way: it makes decisions
about our decisions. "Trusted" means we keep a decision in the
cupboard, and proceed to rely on it. "Not trusted" means we don't
believe; we set those decisions aside.

### Can't trust this anymore

There are older decisions we no longer believe in. Those are kept
somewhere else, or perhaps discarded. Our memories of decisions past
are an important part of experience. Our past decisions have something
to teach us about the decisions we make today. 

We used to order extra cheese and hot peppers on every pizza. One day,
we made a new decision to stop doing that. Perhaps we even had a good
reason.

The old decisions are retired and serve as a lesson to us.  The new
decisions which replace them are very much kept in the active
cupboard, to be called upon the next time we're ordering lunch.


### So what

The most important decision you can make is to decide which decisions
you keep.  Trust is what separates them. The decisions you keep are
trusted, those you abandon are untrusted.

The trust recognizer makes the call. It uses hunches, appetites,
experience, reason, evidence, and the suggestions of complete
strangers to make that call. It's fallible and can be manipulated.
But it's in charge of what you believe in.
