Our brains store decisions, like ingredients in a cupboard.  We keep
these decisions around to inform further decisions.  We decide what we
want for lunch, who we'll go out with, or whether the roof needs
fixing. Once we decide what we want for lunch, we then decide how to
go about getting it. Pizza for lunch? The next decision might well be
delivery or pick up.


### Getting more brains

The decisions you keep are not always the decisions you make by
yourself. A friend tells you about a great new pizza place, so you
decide to try it.  That's how we use the brains of others - we rely on
them to give us decisions that we can keep and use later.

Trusted sources are friends whose decisions we adopt.  We adopt their
decisions, often without deep examination, adding them to our own.

### Trust is the decision you keep

When you keep a decision around, you trust it. You tell yourself,
"I've made this decision, it can be used now." It's more comfortable
to keep the decisions you've already made.

It's expensive to go back and check a decision. It takes time and
effort. While you're doing all that checking, you can't move
forward. You might miss out on something.

Of course you can go back and look at it again, maybe even reverse
it. That's ok, it just means you don't trust it any more.

Trust is the great time-saver for brains &mdash; it means you don't need to
go back and revisit a decision you've made.

### The trust recognizer

We have a gatekeeper, which decides what's trustworthy and what isn't.
This is our trust recognizer. It sets the bar for the decisions we
abide by, decisions we disavow, and decisions we need to re-examine.

When we choose what to have for lunch, we're influenced by a wide
range of inputs: hunches, appetites, experience, reason, evidence, and
the suggestions of complete strangers.

Our trust recognizer is no different, it employs the very same tools. 
It's special, because it makes decisions about our decisions. But it
doesn't really work any differently than our other decisions. 

### Can't trust this anymore

There are older decisions we no longer believe in. Those are kept
somewhere else, or perhaps discarded. Our memories of decisions past
are an important part of experience. Our past decisions have something
to teach us about the decisions we make today. We used to order extra
cheese and hot peppers on every pizza, but one day we made a new
decision to stop doing that. Perhaps we even had a good reason.  The
old decision is retired and serves as a lesson to us.  The new
decision which replaced it is very much kept in the active cupboard,
to be called upon the next time we're ordering lunch.


### So what

The most important decision you can make is to decide which decisions
you keep.  Trust is what separates them. The decisions you keep are
trusted, those you abandon are untrusted.

The trust recognizer makes the call. It uses hunches, appetites,
experience, reason, evidence, and the suggestions of complete
strangers to make that call. It's fallible and can be manipulated.
But it's in charge of what you believe in.
