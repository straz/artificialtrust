*AIs make mistakes*.<br/>They are not perfect; they don't always get things right.

*AI mistakes can be serious*.<br/>
If the AI is doing something important, mistakes can have major consequences.

*Mistakes aren't just stochastic or "bad luck"*<br/>
Mistakes reoccur, often in systematic and resilient ways.


*AI mistakes are caused by diseases.*<br/>
<!-- start_excerpt -->
Mistakes reflect flaws and underlying causes, which can be studied.
<!-- end_excerpt -->

*These diseases can be classified, diagnosed, and treated.*<br/>
The way to make AIs safer is to study the etiology of their diseases.

## Major classes of artificial diseases:

<dt>1. Data malnutrition</dt>
<dd>Ingestion of poorly prepared data, such as poor sampling and information pollution</dd>

<dt>2. Parasites</dt>
<dd>Exploitative and hostile activity by adversaries, such as manipulation of ingested data</dd>

<dt>3. Genetic diseases</dt>
<dd>Reproductive flaws in propagation of neural net models</dd>

<dt>4. Recognition diseases</dt>
<dd>Corruption of neural voting mechanisms</dd>
