*AIs make mistakes*.<br/>
They are not perfect. They don't always get things right.

*AI mistakes can be serious*.<br/>
If an AI's job is important, getting something wrong can have major
consequences and potential for harm.

*Mistakes aren't just stochastic or "bad luck"*<br/>
Mistakes reoccur, often in systematic and resilient ways.

*AI mistakes are caused by diseases.*<br/>
<!-- start_excerpt -->
Mistakes reflect their underlying causes, which can be studied.
<!-- end_excerpt -->

*These diseases can be classified, diagnosed, and treated.*<br/>
Make AIs safer by studying the etiology of their diseases.


## Major classes of artificial diseases

<dt>1. Data malnutrition</dt>
<dd>Ingestion of poorly prepared data, such as poor sampling and information pollution</dd>

<dt>2. Algorithmic parasites</dt>
<dd>Exploitative and hostile activity by adversaries, such as manipulation of ingested data</dd>

<dt>3. Fitness drift</dt>
<dd>Environmental novelty, aging, and reproductive flaws in neural net models</dd>

<dt>4. Recognition diseases</dt>
<dd>Corruption of neural signal processing and voting mechanisms</dd>
