**Q.** Why does [this dictionary]({{ "/definitions" | relative_url }}) define two
words at a time instead of one?

**A.** Because contrasts convey meaning more effectively. In this
project, we use differences and contrast to help explain ideas.

People are naturally much better at perceiving a contrast than reading a definition.
It's easier to learn an idea when it's contrasted with another one.
