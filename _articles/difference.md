title: Why the difference?

**Q.** Why does [this dictionary]({{ site.url }}/definitions) define two
words at a time instead of one?

**A.** Because people are naturally much better at perception of
contrasts. A contrast conveys meaning more effectively than reading
definitions.

In this project, we use differences and contrast to help explain
ideas.  It's easier to learn an idea if it's contrasted with another
one.

[Joshua Foer](https://joshuafoer.com/moonwalking-with-einstein/)
showed that humans are really, really bad at memorizing lists. But we're
really, really good at memorizing how to get somewhere. So, he showed
what the Greeks learned: that by imagining a list of items laid out
along a path in space, one can memorize very long lists.

Perception of contrast is like that. For example, engineers are
notoriously very bad at predicting how long a project will take.  But
often they're quite good at comparing two projects, and saying *this
one* will take longer than *that one*. By comparing projects,
engineers can get a sense of their scale and more readily come up with
better predictions of effort required for them. Sometimes, when this
technique is used in software engineering, it's called [planning
