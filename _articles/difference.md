showed that humans a really, really bad at memorizing lists. But
really, really good at memorizing how to get somewhere. So, he showed
what the Greeks learned, that by imagining a list of items laid out
along a path in space, you can memorize very long lists.

Engineers are very bad at predicting how long a project will take.
But we're very good at comparing two projects, and saying this one is
longer than that one. By comparing projects, engineers can get a sense
of their scale and come up with better predictions of effort required
for them.

In this project, we use differences and contrast to help explain
ideas.  It's easier to learn an idea if it's contrasted with another
one.
