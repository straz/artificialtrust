title: Certainty and confidence
released: true
---

Certainty is the *feeling* that you're right about something. You feel confident and sure, you *know* you're right.

Both our intuitive and rational systems have ways of creating the
feeling of certainty. 

The rational sense of certainty comes from proof: we can verify the
chain of steps leading to our conclusions. That is the purpose of
rationality, it allows us to slowly check our conclusions. When our
conclusions can't be fully proven, we allow that there's room for doubt.

The intuitive sense of certainty cannot be independently verified.
