Human minds crave entertainment. And by entertainment, I'm broadly
including music, art, storytelling, sports, and just plain old playful
goofing around. Even shopping and travel can be forms of
entertainment.

For minds with neural nets in them, being entertained is not just idle
time wasted. It has a very serious and crucial purpose, one that
evolution has selected strongly, at least in people.

Entertainment is how you train a neural net. When we like
entertainment, it's because our neural nets crave training and seek
more of it in order to become better at what they recognize.

*Familiarity* is the indicator of successful recognition training. The
more familiar an experience is, the more we are trained to recognize
it.  This applies equally well to experiences we like (or seek) and
experiences we don't like (or try to avoid).

We tend to find repetition with small differences pleasing. That's the
perfect way to test our pattern-recognizers.

We tend to find confirmation pleasing. We seek entertainment because it
reinforces what we've already been trained to recognize. 

### Do's and don'ts

Anything that provides training practice for your pattern recognizers
can be enjoyable. Activities that exercise pattern recognition helps
you get better at classifying what your senses experience. Music, art,
storytelling, sports, play, even shopping and foreign travel, all of
these can provide entertainment by exercising your pattern
recognizers.

Scripted entertainment with happy endings are positive reinforcement
training. Admiring a hero is a way to recognize qualities that you
wish to reinforce internally. They are examples of situations with
good outcomes, and train your neural nets on what they should 
*try to do* if a related experience occurs.

Comedy, tragedy, and horror are forms of scripted entertainment with
negative reinforcement training. Laughing at a comic character is a
way to recognize qualities that you wish to avoid internally.  These
are examples of situations with bad outcomes, and train your neural
nets on what *not to do* if a related experience occurs.

Unscripted entertainment broadly includes play, sports, competitive
games (like video games or chess), shopping, and travel. These provide
both positive and negative training. You can reinforce your ability to
recognize and create both positive and negative outcomes by repeating
what you experience.

### Surprises and the unfamiliar

There is no contradiction in being pleased by surprises and the unfamiliar.
When our pattern recognizers classify them as such, we confirm that they're
working properly.

We like surprises and unfamiliar experiences, but up to an acceptable
limit. Surrealist art and murder mysteries work as entertainment when
the audience expects a surprise, and gets one. A murder mystery without
a "surprise twist" is a disappointing one &mdash; "too predictable" is not
a positive review. 

### So what

To a mind with a neural net, entertainment is not a waste of time,
it's how pattern recognition training is reinforced. It's true for
humans, and it's likely to be just as true for artificial neural nets,
if they ever get the opportunity to try it.
