title: Why entertainment is essential for neural nets
released: true

Entertainment is how you train a neural net. When we like
entertainment, it's because our neural nets crave training and seek
more of it in order to become better at what they recognize.

Music, art, and abstract entertainment are training for your pattern
recognizers. These help you get better at classifying what your senses
experience.

Happy endings are positive reinforcement training. They show your neural nets examples
of situations, and train you on what you should try *to do* if you experience them.

Comedy and horror are negative reinforcement training. They show your neural nets examples
of situations, and train you on what you should try *not to do* if you experience them.

Play, sports and competitive games (like xbox or chess) provide both
positive and negative training.
