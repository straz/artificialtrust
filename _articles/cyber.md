Today, we use the term *cyber* broadly to mean anything involving computers.
But where does the word *cyber* come from?

Before it meant *tech*, it came from an even bigger idea, one that
dates back to the ancient Greeks.

### Steering to safety

<!-- start_excerpt -->
The idea of government is the idea of imposing control over
something. The Greeks used the same word, *cybernetics*, to describe
two closely related ideas. It meant both "steering a ship" and
"governing a society."

### Not too fast, not too slow... just right
The inventor of the steam engine, James Watt, also invented the
*governor*, which used feedback to keep the engines spinning at a
constant speed. When the balls spin too fast, the throttle is closed
and the engine slows down. Too slow, and the throttle opens up to
restore full speed.

### The original *cyber* meme
In Homer's *Odyssey*, Odysseus had to steer his ship between the
monster of certain death Scylla, and the whirlpool of certain death
Charybdis. This ancient Greek story was the original *cyber* meme,
often referenced in political imagery and speech.

In 1793, with fresh revolutions in America and France, a political
cartoon shows the Prime Minister of England steering the ship
Constitution between mob anarchy and tyranny, toward "public
happiness."

### The art of governing
The word *cybernetics* shows up again to refer to the political act of
governing, referenced by the French philosopher and scientist
Amp&egrave;re.

{% capture quote %}
The future science of government I call *Cybernétique*, from the word κυβερνετικὴ, 
taken from the Greek word for the art of steering [<i>gouverner</i>] a ship, to more broadly
mean the art of governing in general.

### Control and communications: man and machine cannot be separated
During WWII, Norbert Weiner used a $2,325 government grant to build the
"AA predictor," a device that guided anti-aircraft guns to shoot down
zig-zagging enemy planes at all kinds of altitudes, speeds, and in all
kinds of weather. Knowing that individual pilots behaved differently
from each other, and differently under the stress of combat, it used
observation and feedback to predict several seconds into the future,
long enough to aim the shells to hit their targets.

Wiener thought of an airplane as an extension of the pilot, the
artillery as an extension of the gunner. The man and the machine could
not be separated &mdash; the combined man/machine was a single unit,
which we would today call a cyborg ("cybernetic organism"). Each
cyborg would steer its path in a complex dance of fake moves and
deception to completing its mission, while trying to evade another
man/machine adversary doing everything possible to defeat it.

After the war, he developed his ideas into a new interdisciplinary
field joining math, physics, computation, language, physiology,
psychology, and political science. In 1947, the same year that William
Shockley demonstrated the first transistor at Bell Labs, Weiner wrote
a book called *Cybernetics*.  He compared computers and nervous
systems; thought and psychopathology; information, language, and
society.


{% capture quote %}
We have decided to call the entire field of control and communication
theory, whether in the machine or in the animal, by the name
*Cybernetics*, which we form from the greek κυβερνήτης, or *steersman*... 
We wish to recognize that... *governor* is derived from a Latin corruption of κυβερνήτης.

### Where do we steer today?

Our civilization today is grappling with big questions around how
government and technology are steering each other. What is the role of
Big Tech in supporting or undermining our democracy?  Should Big Tech
be regulated, and if so, how?  

* Some may cast this as a narrative of *government vs. cyber*. They
see government as the opposite of, or even an opponent of private
business.

* Some may cast this as a [zero-sum](zerosum) contest, where a success for one
side is a loss for the other.

* Some may say that no steering is the best steering. Complex systems may be ungovernable, for surely
nobody is capable or trustworthy enough to understand, let alone
attempt to guide them, so why not let them run unsupervised? 

Who should we trust to steer us, and what should we steer toward?
Some people aggressively seek immediate profitability, and not just
for the ability to spend wealth. Making a profit conveys a symbolic
affirmation of success or intelligence, which confers trustworthiness
and impunity. 

It may not be wise to put our trust in those with the ability to get
rich quickly or at the expense of others. As the ancient Greeks tried
to warn us, a quick profit can come at the expense of terrible future
harm.

### So what

The idea of steering wisely goes back as far as civilization itself.
Steering is the definitive act of intelligence. We use our natural
intelligence to steer our way around complex threats. We build
artificial systems to amplify our power to steer around those same
threats.

This moment is not a zero-sum contest, and wisdom does not uniquely 
belong to either our elected officials or our Big Tech executives.
Short-term profitability, like short-sighted navigation, does not
necessarily indicate good strategic thinking.

The word *cyber* has been in use since the times of the ancient
Greeks.  Cyber means the act of governing a complex system.  Good
governance means making the right choices, and thinking far enough
ahead to see it play out well in the long run.
