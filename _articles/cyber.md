We use the term *cyber* broadly to mean anything involving computers.

Where does the word *cyber* come from? Before it meant *tech*, it came
from an even bigger idea, one that dates back to the ancient Greeks.

### Steering to safety

The idea of government is the idea of imposing control over
something. The Greeks used the same word, *cybernetics*, to describe
two closely related ideas. It meant both "steering a ship" and
"governing a society."

   a country. Plato attributes Socrates as saying, \"Cybernetics saves the souls, 
   bodies, and material possessions from the gravest dangers.\""

### Not too fast, not too slow... just right
The inventor of the steam engine, James Watt, also invented the
*governor*, which used feedback to keep the engines spinning at a
constant speed. When the balls spin too fast, the throttle is closed
and the engine slows down. Too slow, and the throttle opens up to
restore full speed.

### The original *cyber* meme
In Homer's *Odyssey*, Odysseus had to steer his ship between the
monster of certain death Scylla, and the whirlpool of certain death
Charybdis.

The ancient Greek story was the original *cyber* meme, often
referenced in political imagery and speech. In 1793, with fresh
revolutions in America and France, this political cartoon shows the
Prime Minister steering the ship Constitution between mob anarchy and
tyranny, toward "public happiness".

### The art of governing
The word *cybernetics* shows up again to refer to the political act of
governing, referenced by the French philosopher and scientist
Amp&egrave;re.

{% capture quote %}
The future science of government I call *Cybernétique*, from the word κυβερνετικὴ, 
taken from the Greek word for the art of steering [<i>gouverner</i>] a ship, to more broadly
mean the art of governing in general.

### Control and communications: man and machine cannot be separated
During WWII, Norbert Weiner used a $2,325 government grant to build the
"AA predictor," a device that guided anti-aircraft guns to shoot down
zig-zagging enemy planes at all kinds of altitudes, speeds, and in all
kinds of weather. Knowing that individual pilots behaved differently
from each other, and differently under the stress of combat, it used
observation and feedback to predict several seconds into the future,
long enough to aim the shells to hit their targets.

Wiener thought of an airplane as an extension of the pilot, the
artillery as an extension of the gunner. The man and the machine could
not be separated &mdash; the combined man/machine was a single unit,
which we would today call a cyborg ("cybernetic organism"). Each
cyborg would steer its path in a complex dance of fake moves and
deception to completing its mission, while trying to evade another
man/machine adversary doing everything possible to defeat it.

After the war, he developed his ideas into a new interdisciplinary
field joining math, physics, computation, language, physiology,
psychology, and political science. In 1947, the same year that William
Shockley demonstrated the first transistor at Bell Labs, Weiner wrote
a book called *Cybernetics*.  He compared computers and nervous
systems; thought and psychopathology; information, language, and
society.


{% capture quote %}
We have decided to call the entire field of control and communication
theory, whether in the machine or in the animal, by the name
*Cybernetics*, which we form from the greek κυβερνήτης, or *steersman*... 
We wish to recognize that... *governor* is derived from a Latin corruption of κυβερνήτης.
