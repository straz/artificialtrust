#### Not too fast, not too slow... just right

The idea of government is the idea of imposing control over
something. The Greeks used the same word (cybernetics) to describe
both steering a ship and governing a society.

The inventor of the steam engine, James Watt, also invented the
*governor*, which used feedback to keep the engines spinning at a
constant speed. When the balls spin too fast, the throttle is closed
and the engine slows down. Too slow, and the throttle opens up to
restore full speed.

In Homer's *Odyssey*, Odysseus had to steer his ship between the
monster of certain death Scylla, and the whirlpool of certain death
Charybdis.  In 1793, with fresh revolutions in America and France, the
ancient Greek story was the original cyber-meme, often referenced in
political imagery and speech. In this one, the Prime Minister steers
the ship Constitution between mob anarchy and tyranny toward "public
happiness".

The word *cybernetics* shows up again to refer to the political act of
governing, referenced by the French philosopher and scientist
Amp&egrave;re.

The future science of government I call *Cybernétique*, from the word κυβερνετικὴ, 
taken from the Greek word for the art of steering (<i>gouverner</i>) a ship, to more broadly
mean the art of governing in general.

During WWII, Norbert Weiner used a $2,325 government grant to build an
"AA predictor," a device that guided anti-aircraft guns to shoot down
zig-zagging enemy planes at all kinds of altitudes, speeds, and in all
kinds of weather. Knowing that individual pilots behaved differently
from each other, and differently under the stress of combat, it used
observation and feedback to predict several seconds into the future,
long enough to aim the shells to hit their targets.

Wiener thought of an airplane as an extension of the pilot, the
artillery as an extension of the gunner. The man and the machine could
not be separated &mdash; the combined man/machine was a single unit,
which we would today call a cyborg ("cybernetic organism"). Each
cyborg would steer its path in a complex dance of fake moves and
deception to completing its mission, while trying to evade another
man/machine adversary doing everything possible to defeat it.

After the war, he developed his ideas into a new interdisciplinary
field joining math, physics, computation, language, physiology,
psychology, and political science. In 1947, the same year that William
Shockley demonstrated the first transistor at Bell Labs, Weiner wrote
a book called *Cybernetics*.  He compared computers and nervous
systems; thought and psychopathology; information, language, and
society.

We have decided to call the entire field of control and communication
theory, whether in the machine or in the animal, by the name
*Cybernetics*, which we form from the greek κυβερνήτης, or *steersman*... 
We wish to recognize that... *governor* is derived from a Latin corruption of κυβερνήτης.

We use the term *cyber* broadly to mean anything computer-y, anything on the net. We use
*cybersecurity* to refer to protection from computer-based crime.

where does cyber come from


κυβερνητικόςχ






[Cybernetics]()

1. It comes from the Greek word κυβερνητικός meaning "skilled in steering or governing".

Piloting, steering
2. The obstacle course and the Constitution
  Steering between anarchy and despotism
It became a metaphor for the constitution - what to do after the American and French revolutions?
Scylla &amp; Charybdis was a meme, a big one.

3. Norbert Weiner coined *cybernetics* in 1947

By itself, a steam engine will speed up and slow down unexpectedly,
based on how much steam it's generating. James Watt, the inventor of
the steam engine, invented the gadget (called a governor) to make sure
that doesn't happen.  The governor makes sure the shaft spins
constantly at whatever speed you set it for, without surprises.

If you've ever seen a steam engine, perhaps in a movie, you may have
seen this thing with spinny balls on the top.  The faster it spins,
the further apart the balls (E) fly.  This makes (F) move lower, which
pushes a lever which slows down the spinner back to the proper
speed. Likewise, if the shaft spins too slowly, the lever goes the
other way and makes it spin faster.
