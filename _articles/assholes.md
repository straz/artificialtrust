title: Assholes and cancer have a lot in common

The people who confront cancer &mdash; the doctors, the patients, the
families and friends of those patients &mdash; I've heard them refer
to cancer as an "asshole" of a disease. Along with cancer, I include
autoimmune diseases (like rheumatoid arthritis and lupus) in this
category.

The people who confront assholes &mdash; people whose lives are hurt
by those who lie, cheat, and steal &mdash; I've heard them refer to
those assholes as "a cancer" on society. By "asshole" in this context,
I'm referring to con men, corrupt politicians, and members of
organized crime.

I've come to believe that there's more going on here than just anger
and hyperbolic wordplay. I think that quite literally, there is a
common mechanism at work here that bears closer examination.

Cancer and autoimmune diseases are in a different class from
pathogen-borne diseases like chickenpox or measles. We have a
well-understood playbook for fighting pathogens: first, isolate the
pathogen. Then, create a vaccine for it which trains your immune
system to recognize it reliably whenever it shows up. Then, distribute
the vaccine to everyone.

This approach seems to work well for many pathogens &mdash; societies that
adopt this approach have done a great job with some pathogens like
smallpox and polio. But the results for cancer and autoimmune diseases
have not been as forthcoming.

Assholes seem to be in a different class from ordinary criminals like
bank robbers and arsonists. We have a well-understood playbook for
fighting ordinary criminals: first gather evidence of criminal
activity. Then, find suspects who are undeniably linked to the
evidence. Then, prosecute the suspects in a fair trial using the
evidence to conclusively prove their guilt or innocence.

This approach seems to work well for many kinds of crime &mdash;
societies that adopt this approach have reduced some kinds of crime a
great deal. But society has not seemed to had much success reducing
the prevalence of con men, corrupt politicians, and organized crime.

### Similarity one: it's an inside job

The first line of defense in a security system is having a way to
detect outsiders.  With ID badges and passwords, security systems
distinguish between "us" and "them" - if you have a valid ID badge,
you're one of "us" and you can enter the building.

The immune system is a security system that also distinguishes between
"body" and "foreign". Invading pathogens are recognized as foreigners,
and lymphocytes are dispatched to eliminate them.

#### Implication: you can't use identity to detect the enemy

Cancer cells aren't foreign invaders, they're cells from your own
body. Your immune system treats them as if they have valid ID badges and
passwords (because they actually do), and doesn't attack them.

In autoimmune diseases, your immune system somehow mistakes your legit
body cells for invaders and attacks them anyway. It's as if their
valid ID badges and passwords are being ignored.

Security measures that rely on checking ID credentials are not helpful
against these kinds of threats. You cannot use identity to detect the
enemy when the enemy already has proper ID credentials.


### Similarity two: corruption of the regulatory system

To fight diseases and criminals, your body has an immune system, and
your society has a criminal justice system. The "ordinary" diseases
and "ordinary" criminals tend to be stopped by these systems, when
they're working properly. 

The thing that differentiates asshole-diseases from their "ordinary"
counterparts is that they corrupt the systems that are supposed to
regulate them. A compromised immune system cannot fight disease
properly, and a compromised justice system cannot fight crime
properly.

#### Implication: checks and balances fight corruption

It doesn't matter how much evidence you have of a crime if the judge
is one of the criminals. And you can't count on a compromised immune
system to eliminate disease.

The creators of the US Consititution understood this idea in a very
deep and profound way.


### Similarity three: co-opting the enablers

The enablers make it possible - innervation, vasculature
