The people who confront cancer &mdash; the doctors, the patients, the
families and friends of those patients &mdash; I've heard them refer
to cancer as an "asshole" of a disease. 

The people who confront assholes &mdash; people whose lives are harmed
by con men, bullies, and corrupt politicians who lie, cheat, and steal &mdash;
I've heard them refer to those assholes as "a cancer" on society.

I've come to believe that there's more going on here than just anger
and hyperbolic wordplay. I think that quite literally, a common
mechanism is at work here which bears closer examination.

### It's an inside job

What they have in common: they exploit how we place our trust. The
"con" in con man comes from "confidence", someone who creates
[artificial trust]({{ '../definitions/trust' | relative-url }} ),
looking more like a friend than an enemy. These attacks are an
inside job &mdash; the kind of attack which we are just not good
at dealing with.

Our immune system works by identifying pathogens as *outsiders*.  But
cancer cells are not outsiders. Our cells are trusted, they all grow
from other trusted cells in our bodies. Cancer cells thrive by
displaying all the right proteins to avoid being recognized as enemies
by our immune system.

Similarly, autoimmune diseases are not outsider attacks. The attackers
are trusted members of our own immune system, mistakenly attacking
fellow cells that belong to the same body.

When we trust con men and corrupt politicians, they are not outsiders.
We give them access to our lives and our bank accounts, we vote them
into office, willingly giving them power over us. 

### Us and them

The first line of defense in a security system is having a way to
detect outsiders. Historically, we bond with members of our family and
our tribe, those who resemble ourselves. We stick together for safety
and survival.

In modern times, security systems use ID badges and passwords
distinguish between "us" and "them." In polarized social media, we
proclaim our loyalties reflexively.  Instantly recognizable symbols
quickly assign "us" and "them" labels to everyone we encounter. At the
Thanksgiving table, we're aggravated the most by relatives who should
be "us" but turn out to be "them."

The immune system is a security system that also distinguishes between
"body" and "foreign." Invading pathogens are recognized as foreigners.
Agents of the immune system, like T-cells, are dispatched to eliminate
them.

### Your credentials, please

When deciding whom to trust, we often turn to credentials. By
displaying the right credentials, a person (or a cell) often can carry
on without further questioning. The credentials are a form of
shortcut, a talisman of trust. They save everyone the hassle of
repeated investigation.

Credentials help you detect outsiders, but are useless against
traitors. An executive who embezzles has all the valid credentials for
the company that hired them.


*Insider jobs* are the hardest kind of attack to protect against.  To
stop an insider attack, you have to ignore the very credentials you
issued, and investigate those who are carrying them. Instead of
subjecting outsiders to scrutiny, you're stopping and questioning
members of your insider group. No wonder it's painful and inefficient.

Cancer cells aren't foreign invaders, they're cells from your own
body. A false negative arises when a tumor cell is misrecognized as a
healthy one. Your immune system treats them as if they have valid
credentials (because they actually do), and doesn't attack them.

Recognition of friendlies is not perfect. A false positive arises when
an innocent insider is mistakenly seen as a stranger. Their valid
credentials are misread, causing autoimmune disease. People are
arrested or shot by the police that are supposed to protect
them. Cells are attacked and destroyed by the body's own immune
system. The false negatives can be as harmful as false positives.


### Manipulating the lawmakers

To fight diseases, your body has an immune system, and to fight crime,
society has laws. These are meant to define what is unacceptable
behavior, and to put a stop to it. The immune system regulates disease
in the body, and the legal system regulates dangerous behavior.  These
systems are not perfect, but they tend to keep us safe and alive.

If cancer and assholes only attacked ordinary neighbors and stole from
them, they would eventually get caught. To avoid capture, they have to
manipulate the very systems that are in place to catch them. They use
[artificial trust]({{ '../definitions/trust' | relative-url }} ) to
achieve impunity.

Cancer and autoimmune diseases thrive by manipulating and evading the
immune system. Criminals thrive when they corrupt the legal system
that's supposed to catch them. 

### Co-opting the enablers

While the immune system or justice system are supposed to stop
threats, cancer and criminals continue to get support from those who
unwittingly enable the behavior.

By going about their business as usual, these enablers make it
possible for cancer and criminals to thrive. As a tumor grows, the
body provides it with nutrients, blood vessels, everything that it
needs to survive, because the body continues to trust it. Criminals
accumulate wealth and power, and enjoy full access to the best that
society can bring to them.

### Turn to the dark side

Assholes have a way of inducing others to be assholes. Abused children
are more likely to grow up to be child abusers, even if they're not
genetically related to the abusers. Criminals and bullies sometimes
inspire others, who see them as [winning](zerosum), to start acting
like them.

Most of us are born with the capacity to be assholes. All of us, at
least in theory, can steal, lie, be mean to others. But thankfully,
most of us don't grow up that way.  We may even be tempted at times,
but we generally join society and generally play by the rules,
respecting others.

Likewise, our cells are innately capable of doing what cancer cells
do: growing without limits, taking resources from other cells. I
imagine metastasis is nothing more than one cell whispering to
another, "You know you want it." Cancer is the dark side of
permission.  It says it's ok to satisfy one's own desires and ignore
the harm it does to others.


### So what

Cancer and assholes have a lot in common, and not just metaphorically.
They are resiliant because they rely on artificial trust, the manipulation
of mechanisms that normally are supposed to protect us from them.

  * they are hard to fight because they're insiders, not invaders
  * they have valid credentials, and seem trustworthy
  * they corrupt the very systems that are meant to catch them
  * they are supported by enablers who provide what they need
  * they tempt others to join them

Protecting ourselves requires different tactics than those used to
stop ordinary diseases and ordinary criminals. Criminal justice was
simpler when death was the penalty for most crimes.  Today our cancer
cures seek to isolate and burn away or cut away the tumor cells. As
our understanding advances, perhaps some day medicine will find better
ways to rehabilitate cancerous cells, restoring their civic
sensibility instead of annihilating them.

Most of us manage to resist a life of crime, and our cells mostly
don't get cancer. But what is the mechanism of getting permission to
harm others?  How do we regulate ourselves, and [govern](cyber) our
own behavior?  And once the line is crossed, is this transformation
reversible?
