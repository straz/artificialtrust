# How labels work

Minds are label machines. The labels are shorthand for what we
recognize from our senses, and how we act with our bodies. In between
recognition and action, how we store and arrange those labels defines
how we think, remember, and plan.

When others have a label for us, we are known to them. The label
identifies us: we belong to a group. The group becomes our
identity. We are no longer an individual, complex person with years of
unique history, extended from a unique combination of 3 billion base
pairs of DNA.  We are reduced - we become a handful of labels that the
others can see.

Labels are about reduction: from a thousand shades of skin color, we
may say "black" or "white."  From a complex political belief
framework, we may say "liberal" or "conservative." And so it goes, the
complex is reduced to a single word, whether it's religion,
occupation, health status, gender identity, age, or wealth. One word,
this label, is all that's needed to conjur a fully-formed image in
your mind about a person. With four or five labels, we feel like we
almost know the person well, and can predict what they will say or do.

But we don't stop there, even this reduction is not enough. These
group labels are further reduced to something we actually rely on,
something much more utilitarian. These utilitarian labels are
friend or enemy, good or bad, trustworthy or unreliable.

There aren't many utilitarian labels, but they have great power over
all our social interactions.  They becomes the shorthand for how we
treat others, and how others will treat us. We welcome friends and
avoid enemies. We seek conversations with the trustworthy, and ignore
what's said by the unreliable. 

So labeling occurs in two steps: recognition and meaning. The first
step, recognition, is when we infer race, occupation, age, or other
group identity.  We see someone, recognize them in terms of a few
succinct labels, and then we apply them. Recognizing a person turns
them into "a pro football player," "an old white man," or "a poor
young Christian female."

Once we recognize, we apply meaning - by applying utilitarian
labels. The utilitarian labels govern our decisionmaking. They tell us
what we do next, how to act or react.

We quickly make utilitarian assumptions about threat level, intent,
and reliability. We each make these judgments based on our experience,
i.e. our own prejudices and biases. Typically, "us" is safer than
"them" - the more labels someone shares with us, the more we feel we
can safely be closer to them, trust them, and work with them.

The emerging AI industry is about the automation of decisionmaking.
We as a society are building AIs that infer utilitarian labels at
industrial scale and act on them.

We are building machines that decide which people are trustworthy or
unreliable, which people are good or bad, and which people are friends
or enemies.
