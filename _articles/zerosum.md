Do you see the world as a contest with winners and losers? Do you
classify everyone as either "allies" or "opponents"? If so, congratulations!
This essay is for you. 

### Zero-sum

In a perfectly zero-sum world, winning and losing is symmetrical.  If
someone scores a point, it means someone else will lose a
point. Passing a car on the highway puts you ahead, and being passed
puts you behind. Making a profit on a stock trade means that someone
else, somewhere, lost the same amount of money on the other side of
the same trade. Hurting your opponent is the same as helping yourself.

Sport championships are typically zero-sum competitions.  In most
sports, a team's standing is really a question of rearranging the
names at the top of the league. In order for one team to move into
first place and win the huge prize, the other teams must move downward
by an equal and opposite amount. To see team A advancing over team B
is the same as having team B fall behind team A.

The same is largely true of elections. Elections are often a zero-sum
game with winners and losers. In a two-party system, the seats lost by
one party are exactly equal and opposite to those won by the other
party. The American press covers politics the same way it covers
sports: as if it were a zero-sum game.

The strategy for zero sum contests is super easy to understand. It's
easy for us to believe in, and it's easy to persuade others to adopt
it. We learn it because some familiar experiences are zero sum
contests, and we grow up with them.

### Asymmetrical effort

Sometimes losing and gaining are not symmetrical. Burning down a house
is easy, but building a house is much harder.  Feeding yourself takes
work and effort. The skills needed to feed yourself are quite
different than the skills needed to ruin someone else's food.

Many in politics have noted that negative ads are both cheaper and
more effective than positive ads. Anger and fear tends to reliably
turn out more voters than satisfaction.

In a zero-sum world, finding a meal means your opponent will go
hungry, and vice-versa. Logically speaking, advancing at the expense
of others is a perfectly sound strategy.

If you find that helping yourself is difficult or expensive, and
hurting others is easy and cheap, the path to success is clear. 

### When zero sum strategies gives you lose-lose

In a world where results have asymmetrical costs, but zero-sum
results, it makes more logical sense to burn down your neighbor's
house than to build yourself a better one. Perhaps you can find a way
to spoil your opponent's meal, causing them to go hungry.

That strategy of course has an obvious flaw. Hurting others doesn't
guarantee that you'll get any food yourself, or get a nice new house.

It's possible for both competitors to end up as losers. The lose-lose
outcome is fairly inexpensive and easy to achieve. It turns out to be
a terrible idea to apply a lopsided strategy in situations which are
not fully zero-sum, but we do it anyway.

### So what

Contests are everywhere. We rely on AI algorithms to classify and
recommend decisions to us. These algorithms in turn present us with
the winners and losers of the contests they run.

When we consider any contest, we should ask whether it is truly
zero-sum. Are we falling for the trap that in order to win, someone
else must lose? Do we encourage attacks on our "enemies," and
celebrate their humiliation and failure? Do we think that the more
they lose, that somehow their losses will result in us getting what we
want?

Thank goodness most of us prefer to build houses rather than to burn
them, because the real world is not a zero-sum contest.

But if we rely on systems that have the zero-sum presumption baked in,
we may surround ourselves with systems that, left unsupervised, prefer
burning houses to building them.
