Do you see the world as a contest with winners and losers? Do you
classify everyone as either "allies" and "opponents"? If so, this
essay is for you. 

### Zero-sum

In a perfectly zero-sum world, winning and losing is symmetrical.  If
someone scores a point, it means someone else will lose a
point. Passing a car on the highway puts you ahead, and being passed
puts you behind. Making a profit on a stock trade means that someone
else, somewhere, lost the same amount of money on the other side of
the same trade. Hurting your opponent is the same as helping yourself.

Sport championships are typically zero-sum competitions.  In most
sports, a team's standing is really a question of rearranging the
names at the top of the league. In order for one team to move into
first place and win the huge prize, another team must move downwards
by an equal and opposite amount. To see team A advancing over team B
is the same as having team B fall behind team A.

The same is largely true of elections. Elections are often a zero-sum
game with winners and losers. In a two-party system, the loss of one
party in terms of seats lost is exactly equal and opposite to the win
of the other party. The American press covers politics the same way it
covers sports: as if it were a zero-sum game.


### Asymmetrical effort

Sometimes losing and gaining are not symmetrical. Burning down a house
is easy, but building a house is much harder.  Feeding yourself takes
work and effort. The skills needed to feed yourself are quite
different than the skills needed to ruin someone else's food.

Many in politics have noted that negative ads are both cheaper and
more effective than positive ads. Anger and fear tends to reliably
turn out more voters than satisfaction.

In a zero-sum world, finding a meal means your opponent will go
hungry, and vice-versa. Logically speaking, advancing at the expense
of others is a perfectly sound strategy.

If you find that helping yourself is difficult or expensive, and
hurting others is easy and cheap, the path to success is clear.  In a
world which is zero sum, where results have asymmetrical costs, it
makes more logical sense to burn down your neighbor's house than to
build yourself a better one.


### When zero sum strategies gives you lose-lose

The lopsided zero sum strategy is super easy to understand. We learn
it because it's simple and we intuitively learn it from examples in
real life. It turns out to be a terrible idea to apply this strategy
outside of those situations, but we do it anyway.

Perhaps you can find a way to spoil your opponent's meal, causing them
to go hungry, or burn down their house. That strategy of course has an
obvious flaw. Hurting others doesn't guarantee that you'll get any
food yourself, or get a nice new house.

The lose-lose outcome is fairly inexpensive and easy to achieve.
It's possible for both competitors to end up as losers. Not every loss
is matched by a gain.

### So what

Contests are everywhere. We rely on AI algorithms to classify and
recommend decisions to us. These algorithms in turn present us with
the winners and losers of the contests they run.

When we consider any contest, we should ask whether it is truly
zero-sum. Are we falling for the trap that in order to win, someone
else must lose?

Thank goodness most of us prefer to build houses rather than to burn
them, because the real world is not a zero-sum contest.

But if we rely on systems that have the zero-sum presumption baked in,
we may surround ourselves with systems that, left unsupervised, prefer
burning houses to building them.
