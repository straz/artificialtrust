### Institutions

Individuals can work together to build physical structures, like
houses, bridges, and factories. But they also build information
structures. An information structure is a set of ideas, shared by a
social group.

*Institutions* are are information structures that outlast the people
who create them. They can be organizations or networks of
organizations, like the court system, the press, markets, hospitals,
or corporations. They can be actionable ideas, like the idea of
marriage, a college degree, or the idea of "an eye for an eye."

You can tell that ants and people are social beings, because they
create institutions. An institution is a durable information structure
that is sustained by the consensus behavior of individuals over time.

### Durable and resilient

An institution lasts because of how it stores and exchanges
information.  Individuals contribute information to institutions,
while at the same time, the institution contributes information to
individuals. It tells them what to do and how to behave.

Over time, the institution takes up permanent residence in a social
group. It accumulates traditions, rules, assigned roles, and ways of
recruiting new members.

### All in your head

Since it's an information structure, institutions are stored in the
minds of their members, and in physical records. Individuals learn
about the institution, how it works, what to expect from it, how to
join it, and what happens if they don't. They teach their children and
their neighbors about it.

To extend personal memory, people record the institution's history in
physical records. Filing cabinets, databases, and statues with bronze
plaques extend the memory of individuals.

As long as this information is retained, and there are people willing
to act on it, the institution lives on. The physical form of the
information does not matter, the institution's preservation is purely
a matter of preserving the information that it's made of.

### Institutions cannot act

This information exchange leads to individual action: the institution
by itself cannot act. An institution cannot cut down a tree, build a
house, or arrest anyone. Only people (or the physical structures they
build) can act. Institutions process information and make decisions,
but ultimately those decisions only become actions when an individual
receives those decisions and acts on them.


Broadly speaking, institutions fail in one of two distinct ways:

* *Hyperinstitutionism* - empowering institutions to the point where
individuals are harmed. These institutions have too much power (or the
wrong kinds of power) over individuals.

* *Hypoinstitutionism* - weakening institutions to the point where
individuals are harmed. These institutions fail to provide the
services they were supposed to.

We talk about institutions in terms of our trust in them. This trust is
itself an institution, a durable information structure that's shared
among individuals.

### So what

How do we make institutions strong enough, but not too strong?  We
want them to be strong enough to protect us and provide us with
services. We don't want them to be too strong and push us
around. [Cybernetics](cyber) is the art of navigating between two
extremes: not too much, and not too little.

In the era of physical warfare, enemies attack our physical structures
with guns and bombs. To weaken or destroy a social group, you
basically needed to attack the physical things produced by that group.

In the era of information warfare, enemies attack our information
structures with [artificial trust](decisions). To weaken or destroy a
social group, you basically need to attack their institutions.
