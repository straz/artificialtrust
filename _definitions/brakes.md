The paradox of brakes is that they make acceleration
sustainable. Brakes are absolutely necessary for survival.

### Accelerators

When something is free (as in freedom), it can accelerate. 

Acceleration is moving forward faster. It's growth, advancement, and
progress. 

Freedom, to some, is the freedom to accelerate as you wish, without
limits or obligations. Growth means more, and more means winning.

We seek acceleration in society, economics, and engineering.
We want our companies and retirement funds to grow. We want faster
airplanes and faster internet connections. We don't want just regular
delivery, we want overnight or same-day delivery, and we want it to be free.

### Brakes

When something is limited or constrained, it will be less free. It is
bound, or regulated.

Brakes are the opposite of accelerators. 

In government and genomics, regulation is the opposite of unlimited
acceleration.  Regulation imposes limits; it is a kind of brake. 

Complex systems (e.g. societies and organisms) require regulation.
When one component decides it wants to accellerate without limits the
result is harm.

Brakes make healthy, steady growth possible.

<hr/>
A car without brakes is unsafe to drive.

An organism without regulation cannot survive. When cells replicate
unchecked, we get cancer.

Unbounded acceleration and growth cause harm (e.g. pollution, crimes,
corruption).  The one who benefits from unlimited growth is not always
the one who pays the price for it.

<hr/>
You can drive a car with good brakes much faster than a car with
terrible brakes.

When cell growth is regulated, the host is cancer-free, and can live much longer.

In societies where laws are created and enforced fairly, corruption is
minimized, innovation thrives, and businesses can prosper.

<hr/>
People and companies try to avoid regulation when it limits their own growth.

Regulators become corrupt when they
benefit from the rules they make at the expense of the general
population.

Without regulation, only those who use brutal power have
freedom. There is also no freedom when regulation is corrupt and
self-serving.

<hr/>
The rule of law is how the interests of all parties are protected.

Once companies achieve dominance, they embrace regulation and participate in
writing favorable regulations to keep out potentially disruptive competitors.
