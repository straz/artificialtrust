### Accelerators

Acceleration is moving forward faster. It's growth, advancement, and
progress. We seek acceleration in society, economics, and engineering.
We want our companies and retirement funds to grow. We want faster
airplanes and faster internet connections. We don't want just regular
delivery, we want overnight or same-day delivery, and we want it to be free.

We don't want to be told "No." We don't want to fill out the paperwork, and we
don't want a committee of strangers saying we can't build something in our
back yard.

Freedom, to some, is the freedom to accelerate as you wish, without
limits or responsibilities. With this viewpoint, all growth is good,
regardless of its effect on others.

### Brakes

Brakes are the opposite of acceleration. They make healthy,
steady growth possible. 

In government and genomics, regulation is the opposite of unlimited
acceleration.  Regulation imposes limits; it is a kind of brake. 

The paradox of brakes is that they make acceleration
sustainable. Brakes are absolutely necessary for survival.

<hr/>
A car without brakes is unsafe to drive.

An organism without regulation cannot survive. When cells replicate
unchecked, we get cancer.

Unbounded acceleration and growth cause harm (e.g. pollution, crimes,
corruption).  The one who benefits from unlimited growth is not always
the one who pays the price for it.

<hr/>
With brakes, you can drive a car faster because you know you can control it at high speeds.

When cell growth is regulated, the host is cancer-free, and can live much longer.

In societies where laws are created and enforced fairly, corruption is
minimized, innovation thrives, and businesses can prosper.

{% capture left3 %}
<hr/>
People and companies try to avoid regulation when it limits their own growth.

When regulation is used for personal gain, it becomes a weapon, not a
protector.  Regulators become corrupt when they benefit from the rules
they make at the expense of the general population.

{% endcapture %}

{% capture right3 %}
<hr/>
Companies embrace regulation and participate in
writing regulations when it keeps out potential competitors.

The rule of law is how the interests of all parties are protected.

Without regulation, only those who use brutal power have
freedom. There is also no freedom when regulation is corrupt and
self-serving.

To say "freedom is better than regulation" misses the point.  Freedom
requires regulation. It cannot exist without regulation that is fair
and applied equally to all.
