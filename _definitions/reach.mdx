Problems come in all shapes and sizes. We're used to thinking about them in terms
of *easy* vs. *hard* problems.

The *reach* of a problem is different from how difficult it may
be. The problem of "what's for lunch" can be easy or difficult, but we
face this problem every day, and the consequences usually fade
quickly.  "Where should I live" is a problem with longer reach. It
arises more rarely and the consequences can have an impact even beyond
one's lifetime.


{% begin split %}
### Short reach problems
*High volume, rapid decisions*: you might face these problems over and
over again
{% middle split %}
### Long reach problems
*Low volume, slow decisions*: you might face these problems
as rarely as once in a lifetime
{% end split %}

{% begin split %}
*Readily available inputs*: the decision must be made with the
information available at hand.
{% middle split %}
*Inputs require pursuit*: before deciding, you may have to investigate further.
{% end split %}

{% begin split %}
*Readily available outcomes*: once the decision is made, 
it's clear whether the decision was good or bad.
{% middle split %}
*Unintended consequences*: once the decision is made, the outcome may
look clear at first, but surprises may arise later.
{% end split %}

{% begin split %}
*Recurring situations*: you can adapt to a problem if it arises repeatedly.
{% middle split %}
*Unique situations*: without repetition, you may have only one shot at
making the right decision
{% end split %}

*Solution tools*: neural nets tend to work well

*Solution tools*: reasoning tends to work well
