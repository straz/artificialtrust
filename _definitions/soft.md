### When emotion > reason

When reason and emotion are in conflict, emotion's role is to add bias
the outcome. Emotion modifies decisions, making them either softer or
harder than decisions you'd make using reason alone.

Emotion is about immediacy; it removes hesitation. For both experts
and beginners, the decision is swift regardless of whether the
decision is wise or unwise.

Emotions can only seem wiser in the short run, or *now*.  Emotions do
not help anyone understand or anticipate the future. Only reason can
do this.  The long term effects of any decision could be the opposite
of the short term effects. This is how you get unintended
consequences.



When emotion modifies reason, it's likely one of these two possible
situations:

### Softer now

Something bad happens, and a response is needed. Applying only logic
and rules, the response would be "by the book," but *softer now* is
the path of compassion and forgiveness. By adding emotion, one can
soften the decision.

### Harder now

Something bad happens, and a response is needed. Applying only logic
and rules, the response would be "by the book," but *harder now* is
the path of anger or fear. By adding emotion, one can intensify the
decision.

{% endcapture %}

{% assign leftmd = left | markdownify %}
{% assign rightmd = right | markdownify %}
{% include twocol.html left=leftmd right=rightmd %}

{% capture left2 %}
In the moment, going easy on someone and bending the rules in their favor
may seem like a wiser choice. 

The future consequences of a *soft now* could be either good (gentleness now
leads to future benefits) or bad (gentleness now leads to bigger problems later on).

{% endcapture %}

{% capture right2 %}


In the moment, responding harshly and "teaching them a lesson" may
seem like a wiser choice. 

The future consequences of a *harder now* could be either good (better safe
than sorry) or bad (overreaction now leads to bigger problems later
on). 


{% endcapture %}

{% assign leftmd = left2 | markdownify %}
{% assign rightmd = right2 | markdownify %}
{% include twocol.html left=leftmd right=rightmd topmargin=false %}

Is bending the rules a smart or dumb idea? Better outcomes can only
come from expertise. Experienced experts use emotion differently than
beginners who face a problem for the first time.

#### Inexperience
Emotion with inexperience is no better than random chance, just more
intense.  It might steer you to a good outcome, or it might bring
disaster. Either way, the result you get is due to dumb luck.

For the inexperienced, emotion provides confidence, not correctness.
With confidence, you can take action and feel great about it in the
moment. If your confidence is entirely unjustified, well, hey, that
just isn't a problem right now.

#### Expertise

For an expert, emotion captures the accumulated wisdom of past
experience. It tells you what has always worked for you in the past,
assuming conditions are pretty much the same.

But emotion tells you nothing about what will work in the future if
conditions change a lot. To see the future under unfamiliar
circumstances, you need reason.  Expertise with logic is the only way
to get an answer for a unique or new situation, something outside your
experience, like [long reach](reach) problems.
