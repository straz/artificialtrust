may seem like a wiser choice. The emotion can only seem wiser in the short run, or *now*.

The future consequences of a *soft now* could be good (gentleness now
leads to future benefits) or bad (gentleness now leads to bigger problems later on).
Emotions do not help anyone understand or anticipate the future.
