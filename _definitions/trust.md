#### Trust
A computational shortcut, in the form of a saved memory that
represents a decision that has been already been made. Trust reduces
the computation needed to be certain, because it relies on computation
that has already been done (either by others or by oneself).

A saved memory is considered trustworthy (or not) by the *trust
recognizer*.  In general, we trust our memories. The trust recognizer
usually says "trustworthy," which is why all intelligences have
confirmation bias.

Without trust, an intelligence would become paralyzed by indecision.
Any one decision could potentially take infinite effort, since every
computational result that the decision relies on would need to be
re-checked again and again.

#### Artificial trust
A false computational shortcut. Artificial trust closely resembles
natural trust, as it reduces the computation needed to achieve
confidence in a result. But in artificial trust, this confidence is
false, because the results are not reliably valid.

Artificial trust is caused by defects in the *trust recognizer*,
either in its algorithm or in the data it is trained on.  These
defects may arise from poor design, or may be the result of hostile
manipulation by an adversary.

#### Trust recognizer
A computational mechanism for deciding what can be trusted, and
therefore, not re-checked.

#### Trusted source
A source whose information does not need to be double-checked for correctness.
In machine learning, all training data is typically assumed to come from a trusted source.
