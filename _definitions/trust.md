### Trust
A computation shortcut, representing a firm belief in something. Trust
reduces the computation needed to be sure of a result, by relying on
computation that has already been done (either by others or by
oneself). Without trust, decisions could take infinite effort, since
every result would need to be re-checked again and again.

### Artificial trust
A false computational shortcut. Artificial trust closely resembles
natural trust, as it reduces the computation needed to achieve
confidence in a result. But in artificial trust, this confidence is
false, because the results are not reliably valid.

Artificial trust is caused by defects in the *trust recognizer*,
either in its algorithm or in the data it is trained on.  These
defects may arise from poor design, or may be the result of hostile
manipulation by an adversary.
 
### Trust recognizer
A computational mechanism for deciding what can be trusted, and
therefore, not re-checked.

### Trusted source
A source whose information does not need to be double-checked for correctness.

### Trusted agent
An agent whose behavior is predictable.
