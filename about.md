## About this site

*Artificial Trust* is a collection of essays, offering
a framework for understanding complex systems. It's an attempt to
explain how algorithms can fail in the things we trust.

We rely on complex systems like our health, our society, and the internet.
These in turn rely on mechanisms to govern themselves and to
evolve. These mechanisms involve feedback and selective pressure,
which in turn rely on some mechanisms of recognition and trust. Some
of the problems we wish to understand better are:

* *health*: why is it so hard to defeat cancer and autoimmune diseases?
* *society*: why is it so hard to defeat corruption and civic division?
* *AI*: why is it so hard to defeat bias and lack of transparency?

When the systems we depend on fail, the ways in which
they fail often have similarities. An interdiciplinary understanding
of these mechanisms can help us manage failures and protect ourselves
from them.
